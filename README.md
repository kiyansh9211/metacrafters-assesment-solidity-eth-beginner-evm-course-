this is a Solidity smart contract for a token called "KIYANSH". The contract includes the following functionalities:

1. Public variables for the token's name, abbreviation, and total supply.
2. A mapping to keep track of the token balances for each address.
3. Two functions:mint" to create new tokens and "burn" to destroy existing tokens.

The "mint" function increases the total supply and adds tokens to the balance of a specified address.

The "burn" function decreases the total supply and reduces the balance of a specified address if it has enough tokens.

Let's go through the code in more detail:

1. Public variables:
   - `tokenName` and `tokenAbbrv`: These variables store the name and abbreviation of the token, respectively.
   - `totalSupply`: This variable keeps track of the total supply of tokens.

2. Mapping variable:
   - ``: This mapping associates each address with its token balance. It stores the number of tokens owned by each address.

3. Mint function:
   - The `mint` function is used to create new tokens and assign them to a specified address.
   - It takes two parameters: `_address` (the address to which tokens will be assigned) and `_value` (the number of tokens to be created).
   - Inside the function, it increases the total supply by adding `_value` and updates the balance of `_address` by adding `_value`.

4. Burn function:
   - The `burn` function is used to destroy existing tokens held by a specified address.
   - It takes two parameters: `_address` (the address from which tokens will be burned) and `_value` (the number of tokens to be burned).
   - Inside this function, it checks if the balance of `_address >= _value`, meaning that there are enough tokens available for burning.
     this condition is satisfied, it decreases both totalSupply and balances[_address] by subtracting _value.

This contract allows for minting new tokens when needed and burning existing ones according to certain conditions. The ownership/balance information is stored in "balances" mapping, ensuring transparency and accountability within this token system.
